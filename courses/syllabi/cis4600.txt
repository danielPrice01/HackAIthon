Course Description
Welcome to CIS 4600: Introduction to Computer Graphics. This course covers the technical aspects of 3D Modeling including viewing transformations, polygon and mesh data structures, keyframe animation, and interactive manipulation. You will write a series program assignments in C++ that build up to a 3D game final project.

Prerequisites
CIS 4600 assumes a solid programming background in Java and/or C. CIS 240 is very strongly recommended. C++ experience is not required but is very helpful. We also expect you to have a minimal background in linear algebra: you should at least be comfortable with matrix multiplication and determinants.

Textbook
There is no required textbook for CIS 4600. We will be providing links to a series of helpful online resources, and may recommend some possible textbooks later in the semester.
