Welcome! Python is a powerful language with both imperative and functional paradigms. As one of the fastest growing languages of all time, Python is widely used across academia and industry. Our goal with this course is to familiarize you with Pythonic coding principles as well as introduce you to the wide use cases of Python and its packages.

Course Policies
Communication
We will primarily use Ed for discussion outside of lecture and office hours. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and the teaching staff. Rather than emailing, we encourage you to post your questions on Ed.

Grading
The grading breakdown is as follows:


Six homeworks (60%)
Final project (25%)
Completion-graded worksheets (10%)
Participation (5%)
Late assignments
Everybody gets five late days for homeworks, and up to two can be used for a single assignment. We'll track late submissions via Gradescope and will record your late day usage automatically, though definitely feel free to ask us at any point in the semester how many late days you have remaining. Beyond these, any late day will incur a penalty of 20% as of the change of date.

Late days only apply to homeworks, so they may not be used for worksheets or the final project.

Collaboration
You are permitted (and encouraged) to discuss the homework problems with other class members, but these discussions are to be limited to high-level concepts. In particular, you are absolutely not permitted to copy/share code or implementation details. Similarly, you are not permitted to use or consult code found on the internet for any of your assignments. The only context where it is permitted to share code is during the final project, during which you are allowed to collaborate with your team members.

Attribution and Licensing
This course would not be possible without the lecture and homework content created by Arun Kirubarajan and Jorge Mendez.

You are free to use or extend these projects for educational purposes provided that:
