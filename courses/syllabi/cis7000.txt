description: Recent advances in machine learning---in particular deep neural networks and large language models, are transforming the design and implementation of decision making systems. However, due to their black-box nature, brittleness, and lack of safety guarantees, significant challenges remain in their adoption in critical and potentially high payoff applications such as autonomous systems and healthcare. The vibrant field of "Trustworthy ML" is developing methods and tools to address questions such as: how can we ensure that a decision recommended by an ML system is always safe? how can we explain the decision made by an ML system to a stakeholder? how can we ensure that an ML system makes its decisions in a fair and ethical manner? The goal of this course is to introduce students to state-of-the-art research in trustworthy ML.

prerequisites: The main prerequisite is CIS 5200 (Machine Learning). The course requires both mathematical maturity, including experience with mathematical proofs, and familiarity with machine learning libraries. It is appropriate for students who wish to pursue research in machine learning.

coursework: There will be four homeworks corresponding to the four course modules. The homework problems will be a mix of mathematical problems and programming exercises. There will be no exams. Each student will be required to do a class project and give a presentation about the project at the end of the semester.
