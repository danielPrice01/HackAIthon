10% Participation
Homework assignments will consist of medium-size projects that lead students through the implementation and application of concepts and tools discussed in lectures, and will be graded on correctness and completeness. An open-ended final project will give students the chance to showcase an interesting project using tools discussed in the course.

Homework assignments will be due Tuesday night at 11:59pm ET. Homework assignments can be submitted late, up to the start of the next class, for a 10% penalty per day late.

Course Materials
There is no required textbook for this course. Lecture notes will be provided that cover everything taught in this course.

Academic Honesty
This course will abide by the University’s Code of Academic Integrity.

For this course, you may not view, share or edit another student’s homework assignment. However, you are allowed (and strongly encouraged) to use the internet when completing homework assignments. Being able to read Open Source documentation and Stack Overflow posts is a crucial skill in the DevOps field. That being said you are not allowed to make any posts online asking for help. Reading existing posts is allowed, but any questions should be asked during Office Hours or on Ed.
