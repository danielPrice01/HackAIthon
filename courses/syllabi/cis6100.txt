Brief description:
This course covers some basic material on manifolds, Riemannian metrics, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and homogeneous manifolds, keeping in mind applications of these theories to machine learning, computer vision and robotics. The treatment will be rigorous but we will try very hard to convey intuitions and to give many examples illustrating all these concepts.
