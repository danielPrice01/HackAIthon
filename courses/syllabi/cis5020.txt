CIS 501: Computer Architecture Fall 2019
Frequently Asked Questions
This iteration of CIS 501 is similar to the Spring 2019 iteration in that we will have the content from CIS 371: Computer Organization & Design (most notably the Verilog processor labs). CIS 240 is the pre-requisite, just like for CIS 371.

Here are answers to some common questions about this offering of CIS 501.

I'm an undergraduate (in CSCI or CMPE) who needs CIS 371 to graduate. What should I do?
You should join the waitlist, and we will try hard to get you into the class.
You should also fill out the electronic CIS Core Requirement Substitution Form. Note that the Petition for Action form is not needed.
Are other iterations of CIS 501 eligible to stand in for CIS 371 credit?
Only the iterations from Spring 2019 and Fall 2019 are eligible.
Is the course content the same for graduate and undergraduate students?
Yes.
I am submatriculating into the CIS MSE. Can I double-count CIS 501 on my undergraduate and graduate degrees?
Yes.
Why was, in essence, the CIS 371 course number changed this semester?
We are working toward a formal cross-listing for the two courses to avoid confusion going forward.

Course Description
This is a second computer organization course and focuses on computer hardware design. In this course you will design and implement a pipelined, superscalar processor for a simple RISC ISA using Verilog. You will learn the range of architectural techniques used in modern CPU design including superscalar design, out-of-order execution, and cache hierarchies.

Prerequisites
CIS 240 and knowledge of at least one software programming language. We do not assume you have any prior experience with Verilog.

Course Materials
The main textbook is Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface by Patterson and Hennessy. The 4th and 5th Editions are both fine. The 4th Edition is available for free on-line through the Penn Library.

Introduction to Logic Synthesis using Verilog HDL by Reese and Thornton is also a nice introduction to hardware design and Verilog. It is also available as a free PDF via the Penn Library.
