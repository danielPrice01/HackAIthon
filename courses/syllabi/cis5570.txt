About the course
This course will focus on web programming and good software development techniques. Teams (of size 2-3) will build and deploy a web application as the class project. We'll explore the "culture" of web programming such as agile methodology, testing, key aspects of software engineering, using web services and APIs, and deploying to the cloud.

Throughout the semester, teams will learn and use the same world-class tools that are used to deploy and build real world web apps such as NodeJS, GitHub, MongoDB, MySQL, Heroku, React, Jest, Selenium, Redux, etc.
