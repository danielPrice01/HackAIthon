Course Description
This is a second computer organization course and focuses on computer hardware design. In this course you will design and implement a pipelined processor for the RISC-V ISA using SystemVerilog. You will learn the range of architectural techniques used in modern CPU design including superscalar design, out-of-order execution, and cache hierarchies.

Frequently Asked Questions
What's the difference between CIS 4710 and CIS 5710?
There is no difference in the course content (assignments, exams, etc.) between CIS 4710 and 5710. If you are a graduate student, however, you'll need to take CIS 5710.

Do all group partners need to be in the same course number?
No, one member can be in CIS 4710 while the other is in CIS 5710.

Prerequisites
Undergraduate students need to have completed CIS 2400.

Graduate students should be familiar with assembly language programming (the language is not so important, all assembly languages are pretty similar), digital circuits (muxes, adders, flip-flops and simple sequential circuits), binary numbers, 2's complement arithmetic, and knowledge of at least one software programming language.

This course does not assume any prior experience with SystemVerilog.

Course Materials
There are no required textbooks.

The most relevant textbook is Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface by Patterson and Hennessy. The 4th and 5th Editions are both fine. The 4th Edition is available for free on-line through the Penn Library.

Introduction to Logic Synthesis using Verilog HDL by Reese and Thornton is also a nice introduction to hardware design and Verilog. It is also available as a free PDF via the Penn Library.

I also like Digital Design: A Systems Approach by Dally and Harting. I'm not aware of a free version, unfortunately. It gives a nice explanation of many of the topics we'll cover in class.

The official RISC-V ISA Specification and our RISC-V ISA quick-reference sheet will also be useful.
