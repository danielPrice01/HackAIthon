For Haskell Programming:

Haskell is a high-level, purely functional programming language with a strong static type system and elegant mathematical underpinnings. In this class, we will learn how (and why) to use it!

Prerequisite: CIS 1200 or equivalent.

Schedule is increasingly tentative for weeks increasingly far in the future. When the materials for the week are finalized, the corresponding row will be updated with a link. All deadlines are at 11:59 p.m.
