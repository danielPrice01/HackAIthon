What are you most excited about for CIS 5520?

• Functional Programming (11x)
• Haskell (6x)
• Learning to be a better programmer (5x)
• Learning different programming techniques and new ways to
solve problems
• Learning the fundamentals behind compilers and query
languages
• Fun with monads. Also really looking forward to the project
• Reassociating with what real-world programming is like.


What type people will likely succeed in the course?

• People with strong background in programming and
mathematics
• No experience with FP expected, but helps
• Undergraduates, Masters, and PhD students together
