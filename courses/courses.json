Perception involves the estimation of the robots motion and path as well as the shape of the environment from sensors. In this course, algorithms will be implemented in Python on mobile platforms on ground and in the air.

The course begins with an exposition of some of the fundamental theorems about the behavior of first-order logic in the context of finite structures, in particular, the Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Theorem and the Trahktenbrot Theorem. The first of these results is used to show limitations on the expressive power of first-order logic over finite structures while the second result demonstrates that the problem of reasoning about finite structures using first-order logic is surprisingly complex. The course then proceeds to consider various extensions of first-order logic including fixed-point operators, generalized quantifiers, infinitary languages, and higher-order languages. The expressive power of these extensions will be studied in detail and will be connected to various problems in the theory of computational complexity. This last motif, namely the relation between descriptive and computational complexity, will be one of the main themes of the course.",

        "description": "The use of logical formalisms in Computer Science is dominated by a fundamental conflict: expressiveness vs. algorithmic tractability. Database constraint logics, temporal logics and description logics are successful compromises in this conflict: (1) they are expressive enough for practical specifications in certain areas, and (2) there exist interesting algorithms for the automated use of these specifications. Interesting connections can be made between these logics because temporal and description logics are modal logics, which in turn can be seen, as can database constraint logics, as certain fragments of first-order logic. These connections might benefit research in databases, computer-aided verification and AI. Discussion includes other interesting connections, eg., with SLD-resolution, with constraint satisfaction problems, with finite model theory and with automata theory.",

        "description": "In the social sciences we often use the word 'explanation' as if (a) we know what we mean by it, and (b) we mean the same thing that other people do. In this course we will critically examine these assumptions and their consequences for scientific progress. In part 1 of the course we will examine how, in practice, researchers invoke at least three logically and conceptually distinct meanings of 'explanation:' identification of causal mechanisms; ability to predict (account for variance in) some outcome; and ability to make subjective sense of something. In part 2 we will examine how and when these different meanings are invoked across a variety of domains, focusing on social science, history, business, and machine learning, and will explore how conflation of these distinct concepts may have created confusion about the goals of science and how we evaluate its progress. Finally , in part 3 we will discuss some related topics such as null hypothesis testing and the replication crisis. We will also discuss specific practices that could help researchers clarify exactly what they mean when they claim to have 'explained' something, and how adoption of such practices may help social science be more useful and relevant to society.",
